It was a youtube channel that started November 13th (Friday the 13th specifically) 2019 which was co-ran by the two creators until the following year November 15th, 2020. In its first video, Ethan and Mark, identifying themselves as &#8220;Unus&#8221; and &#8220;Annus&#8221; respectively, accompanied by a black and white swirling background, describe that they have exactly one year to live, and when the clock runs out, they and their channel will &#8220;die&#8221; and be deleted. Until then, however, they would upload at least one video a day in an attempt to fulfill their bucket list. And naturally, their first official video was called &#8220;Cooking with Sex Toys&#8221; in which they made a full American breakfast only with adult toys.<br/><br/>Throughout the project, their main wish was that nobody actively archive their videos. The meaning of the youtube channel was not to just disappear, but to be remembered and to fade from the memories of the people who experienced it. In fact, they were so dedicated to having their work die with them that they threatened legal action on everyone who dared upload them (albeit semi-jokingly). <br/><br/>The final twelve hours they streamed and discussed everything that had happened within the year. Far before this point, a third person had slowly entered the scene, Mark&#8217;s now fiance Amy and Unus Annus&#8217;s beloved camerawoman. With Mark, Ethan, and Amy finally able to reminisce about their fairly short life, they said their goodbyes to the viewers and deleted the channel live. Of course, despite their wishes people have archived full versions of the channel, mainly on internet archive, and the pages are still popular enough to cause them to lag, showing how beloved the project was to many, many people.<br/></span>
