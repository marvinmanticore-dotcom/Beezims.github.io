<div class="textstyle4"><div id="container_3b62a34e"><div id="container_3b62a34e_padding" ><div class="textstyle1">  <span class="textstyle3">I think when we talk about anthropology and the topic of &quot;animalization&quot;, there&#8217;s a little humorous nagging feeling that tugs at my brain. A little voice in my head that says, &#8220;You know furries exist, right?&#8221;<br/><br/>Now I know that furries don&#8217;t claim to think they&#8217;re actual animals; for those unaware, furries (at the very minimum) are people who like anthropromorphized animal characters. Fundamentally, this is a preference for design, or an identity-link (for lack of a better phrasing) with animalistic characteristics, behavior or physical look. The unfortunate truth of describing what a furry is, is that the community/description of what a furry can be is so large encompassing in what an identity could be makes it difficult to describe on a minute level. Many people see it as a significant part of their identity; there are comparisons that could be made to the way that people are treated when others find out they are furries and when they are gay. There are thousands and thousands of videos uploaded of furries being the brunt of verbal abuse or even physical assault just because of the fact that they are furries. People who are furries who &#8220;come out&#8221; to their families, showing them their fursuits (a mascot-esq costume of their own character), either being accepted or ostracized from their families because of it. Of course, there are disputes on whether or not the two can truly be compared. However, there is a group of people who do identify with animals and identify with the idea of &#8220;animalism&#8221;; Therians. <br/><br/>Therians, more often than not, do not identify with furries but rather actual animals. It&#8217;s more akin to the belief of spirit animals, except Therians identify with the spirit of a specific animal. They make a conscious effort to be grounded and understanding with the earth; training their bodies to walk on all fours, adorning masks and taxidermied tails of the animals they feel spiritually connected with. From an anthropological perspective, Therians are an interesting combination between identity and beliefs. <br/></span>
