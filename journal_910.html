Let me make my stance clear; I think Toby Fox is one of the best &#8220;natural&#8221; story tellers of all time, and I think that once you&#8217;re introduced to his stories they never truly leave. I think our standards, or whatever word you&#8217;d like to use for this phenomenon, have slipped. What I mean is art has become accepting of the commercial. So much so that there are people out there actively trying to capitalize and make as much money for as little money as possible with art. And for that reason, I believe, or perhaps hope, that there is a growing shift. A revolution. There are these sparks in the dark, such as the likes of Fox, that absolutely explode. Flow, a movie produced in the free 3D modeling and animating program by a single person is another. The release of Silksong, even studio-made movies, like Blumhouse and Cawthon&#8217;s Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s, Ironlung by Mark Fischbach&#8211; all of these projects, all indie, all containing something; but what is it? Is there even a word for it?<br/><br/>It doesn&#8217;t feel like anything else in the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/></span></div>
