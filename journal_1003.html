Stories that are fundamentally changed (either from writer's choice or more often pressured from censorship applied by businesses) once discovered are mourned. I think it's just interesting (as well as a huge fear of mine as a writer) that people miss stories they haven't heard. This post is shorter because I'm going to donate blood today which usually leaves me a little tired, so see you next week.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></div>
