I think it takes a certain gusto to do it. I think paired with the daily life of having to do it affects a lot of people, maybe more than they let on. I think I'm the same.<br/><br/>    The pressure of writing something considered &quot;good&quot; is immense, except when it isn't. In my opinion, I think we're in a really odd time, specifically for writing. I think that it's amplified that artists are notorious for either being incredibly doubtful and pessimistic about their work or being complete egomaniacs. It's pretty funny how little &quot;in the middle&quot; artists I interact with. I've had interactions with people who believe their very first and only project will be their magnum opus and I've met people who refuse to work on a project in fear of messing it up. In all honesty, I'm sure I've been both at some point in my life. <br/><br/>    Do I think the terrarium that I've made is the best one that I'll ever make? No, not by a long shot. But I don't think it's half bad. I've learned a lot from it (and that I can paint minifigures fairly well apparently), so I'm not against making a new one, maybe a larger one. It's surprising, but Facebook Marketplace is constantly full of old aquariums for cheap that need a home, and I think the next one I build I'd like to make will have more foliage and less plants that are taller. I was really focused on the fountain being an integral part of the terrarium, and while it is, I think maybe making a fountain from scratch with aquarium foam sounds incredibly challenging and even more fun. <br/><br/>    I've also learned a lot about myself, frankly. Not in a &quot;I am surprised by the consequences of my life&quot; way, but in a &quot;hey, I can actually do a hobby!&quot; way. </span>
