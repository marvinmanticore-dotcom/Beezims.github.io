<div class="textstyle1"><span class="textstyle3"><br/><br/>I got my plants in the terrarium! I needed to get them in this past weekend since I&#8217;ll be without them for a week, which will give the terrarium time to establish. Establishing a terrarium can be a turbulent experience; in fact, it&#8217;ll probably take around a year to see the actuality of what&#8217;s working in the terrarium and what hasn&#8217;t. Ideally, all of the plants explode in growth and give me more work in the form of trimming and removing some. Worst case scenario, they all die and I&#8217;ve wasted around $15. <br/><br/><br/></span></div>

<div class="textstyle1"><span class="textstyle3"><br/>I tried to pick plants that both work well for a terrarium while also being more accurate to theories about the climate, which was warm, forested and considered subtropical. However, two of the plants I chose were extremely biased: A Calathea and a Moon Valley Pilia. <br/><br/>I got the Calathea from a school event; there was a table outside one of the buildings filled to the edges with common household plants. I chose one that I both liked and felt could work in the high humidity terrarium.<br/><br/>When picking out the other plants, my partner found a Moon Valley Pilia and took a liking to it, so while it&#8217;s not quite as accurate as a pick, I&#8217;m dedicated to keeping it alive. In fact, doing research about it, it is presumably a plant that would thrive in a terrarium like this, so we will see how it does. While it&#8217;s more desired for its leaf texture, I hope that I can get it to bloom since I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s difficult to do so when it&#8217;s in an indoor environment. If it does bloom, I will take it as a sign of success regarding the substrate I created for it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, the spray bottle I picked out to simulate mist and rain was NOT that, so until I get a proper one it will look like I&#8217;m shooting my plants with a pistol.<br/><br/>(UPDATE: When I got home, the Moon Valley Pilia was flowering :D)<br/><br/></span></div>
