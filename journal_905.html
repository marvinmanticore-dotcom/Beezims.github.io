However, I plan to tie it back to issues I&#8217;ve been thinking about recently; specifically for plants, I was thinking either the environmental factors caused by generative AI (and comparing/contrasting them to the one that the Cretaceous period most likely had) or the current online environment regarding dinosaurs, which is only becoming more sensationalized.<br/><br/>Really either way will be up to the direction the process goes. As of now I&#8217;m aiming for five categories; Design, Dinosaurs, Plants, Terrain, and Care. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span><img src="images/pasted_image_2.jpg" width="800" height="600" id="img_7062c2b0" alt="" title="" /><span class="textstyle3"> </span><img src="images/pasted_image_3.jpg" width="843" height="640" id="img_12d1eed0" alt="" title="" /><img src="images/pasted_image_4.jpg" width="900" height="690" id="img_5616e585" alt="" title="" /><span class="textstyle3"><br/><br/></span></div>
