<div class="textstyle4"><div id="container_40cee31b"><div id="container_40cee31b_padding" ><div class="textstyle1">  <span class="textstyle3">There&#8217;s a consistent mantra online that says &#8220;everything that&#8217;s uploaded on the internet, stays there forever.&#8221; Essentially it boils down to two things; whatever information someone puts on the internet cannot be undone, and that information and knowledge on the internet is considered public use. <br/><br/>By public use, I&#8217;m referring to the anti-censorship pro-pirating zero-privacy stance some users on the internet (or that heavily use the internet) believe in. This is displayed by the heavily documented and archived life of an individual named Chris Chan, of which I HEAVILY advise to not go searching for without (safe) drug use (of any kind). Chris Chan is regarded as the most documented person in history, with information going back to the 1990s and being updated on a day to day basis in the present. If you&#8217;re somehow skeptical, consider that the comprehensive documentary made about them currently (ongoing) has 91 episodes in total. If you&#8217;re even more skeptical, consider that each episode is around 45 minutes in length. If, somehow, you&#8217;re still skeptical, consider that the creator is only taking a hiatus and the end of episode 91 marked the end of &#8220;season one&#8221;. <br/><br/>	If you are morbidly curious, have a strong stomach (and I mean STRONG), and have a little under 90 hours to spend, the documentary is up on youtube by the user Geno Samuel, titled &#8220;Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History&#8221;. However, I would spend that time watching the next nonconsensual archive I&#8217;ll be discussing.<br/></span>
