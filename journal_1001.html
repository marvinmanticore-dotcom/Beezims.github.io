<div class="textstyle4"><span class="textstyle3">Faun. . . ah</span></div>
<div class="textstyle1"><span class="textstyle3"><br/><br/>I&#8217;m beginning to consider adding more fauna to my terrarium, or perhaps building another at a later time that has living fauna. With this terrarium, I want to make a false ecosystem with false fauna to demonstrate a living one. So I&#8217;m considering adding a few more models in addition to the Tyrannosaurus&#8217;s to maybe add a sense of fullness and make them feel (not literally) less lonely. <br/><br/>There are specifically two choices I&#8217;m leaning towards; alamosaurus and microraptors. These two creatures could (theoretically) more coexist with a pair of tyrannosauraids both because of their size and their nature. <br/><br/></span></div>

<div class="textstyle1"><span class="textstyle3"><br/><br/>Alamosaurus were long-necked heavy-set herbivores that were prey to the Tyrannosaurus, however because of how large they were they could easily withstand larger predators. Microraptors were the opposite; they were so small and fast that they most likely didn&#8217;t get caught super often. <br/><br/>Fun fact: Microraptor fossils were so well preserved that we do actually know what they looked like and what colors they were! They were black with a blue and green iridescent sheen, most like crows and corvids in the present.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></div>
