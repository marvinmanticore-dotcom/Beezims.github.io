Going further on how I&#8217;d like to organize this project, I&#8217;d like to talk about a series of subjects that are more or less related to the terrarium&#8211; siblings, cousins, a twice-removed great aunt of topics, so to speak. When it comes down to it, dinosaurs aren&#8217;t the &#8220;real&#8221; speaking point of the project, but more so a stable place to return to when a topic runs out, and a way to move to the next talking point in a way that seems more logical than an overall demonstration. <br/><br/>In short, it will be a collection of essays that all link to one another, like talking points in the same video. <br/><br/><br/></span></div>
